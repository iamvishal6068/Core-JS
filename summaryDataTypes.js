// Primitive datatypes
// it is also known as call by value data Types bcz it is predefined and it is of 7 types =>
    // String, Number, Boolean, BigInt, Undefined, Symbol, null

// Non_primitive => it is also known as user defined data tyes bcz we call it by references and these are =>
//     objects, arrays, functions

// Javascript is dynamaically typed language or statically typed??
// JavaScript is a dynamic language and not static, which means that variables can hold values of different types during runtime. 
// Unlike languages such as Typescript or Java, you don't need to declare the data type of a variable explicitly.


//++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
// Heap and Stack Memory

// Stack Memory => in stack memory we store the primitive data types in the stack formate and when we assign the value
// of a variable to the new varible it copy the variable and stores into them.(image is in javascript file on desktop)


// Heap Memory => in heap memory we store the user defined or reference data type i.e arrays and objects
